# API Changelog

## 2026-04-27

- Added `/atom.xml` as a registry update feed alongside `/feed.xml`.
- Added factual `trustSignals` metadata to registry search, feeds, and entry detail artifacts.
- ~~Added a dry-run-first Resend Templates sync command for dashboard review without app-side sending.~~ **Superseded:** React Email / Resend Templates sync was removed; newsletter send is fully automated via the Worker + Resend (see `docs/newsletter-resend-playbook.md` and `apps/web/src/lib/newsletter-emails.ts`).
- Strengthened generated README validation so category counts and every file-backed entry stay aligned.
- Added sharded distribution feeds under `/data/feeds/` for category and platform consumers.
- Added IndexNow release submission tooling guarded to production URLs.
- Added the browser-side Agent Skill package validator at `/tools/skill-validator`.
- Added platform compatibility pages under `/platforms/` for Agent Skills and generated adapters.
- Added the read-only `@heyclaude/mcp` package for registry search, detail, compatibility, install guidance, adapter lookup, and feed discovery.
- ~~Added React Email source templates with rendered Resend Broadcast HTML/text artifacts.~~ **Superseded:** same as above — templates are in-worker string builders, not React Email.
- Added generated skill platform compatibility metadata for native Agent Skills platforms and adapter targets.
- Added generated Cursor `.mdc` skill adapters under `/data/skill-adapters/cursor/`.
- Added deployment artifact validation for preview release candidates.
- Clarified that registry publishing remains outside the public API.

## 2026-04-26

- Added read-only registry endpoints for manifest, categories, search, entry detail, and per-entry LLM text.
- Added `ETag` support to static registry API responses for cheaper client sync.
- Added `/api/registry/feed` as a lightweight read-only descriptor for downstream builders.
- Added `/api/intent-events` for privacy-light copy/open/install/download/vote intent metrics.
- Added token-protected listing lead review/export with JSON and CSV responses.

All public registry payloads remain read-only and versioned. Editorial content
continues to be sourced from the Git-backed registry, while votes, leads,
placements, jobs, and intent metrics remain dynamic state in `SITE_DB`.
